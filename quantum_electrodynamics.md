# Quantum Electrodynamics

## Where are we in our understanding of Quantum Electrodynamics?

Check out this excerpt from Ben Franklin's pivotal *Experiments and Observations on Electricity*

	"The first is the wonderful effect of pointed bodies, both in <em>drawing off</em> and <em>throwing off</em> the electrical fire. For example:

	Place an iron shot of three or four inches diameter, on the mouth of a clean dry glass bottle. By a fine silken thread from the celing, right over the mouth of the bottle, suspend a small cork-ball, about the bigness of a marble; the thread of such a length, as that the cork-ball may rest against the side of the shot. Electrify the shot, and the ball will be repelled to the distance of four or five inches, more or less, according to the quantity of Electricity. When in this state, if you present to the shot the point of a long slender sharp bodkin, at six or eight inches distance, the repellency is instantly destroy'd, and the cork flies to the shot.
