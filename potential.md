# Electric Force, Electric Field, Electric Potential Energy, Electric Potential?

Read about Electric Force ($F_E$), Electric Field ($E$), Electric Potential Energy ($PE_E$ or $U$), and Potential Difference ($\Delta V$), and it will become clearer.


## Electric Force - Coulomb's Law, Electric Field

*Coulomb's Law* states that the Electric Force ($F_E$) between two charged particles (with charges $q_1$ and $q_2$), separated by a distance ($r$) is:

$$F_E = \frac{kq_1 q_2}{r^2}$$

Distance is measured in *meters* ($m$), charge is measured in *coulombs* ($C$), and Force is measured in *newtons* ($N$). The constant $k$ is equal to $9\times 10^9 \frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$.

Newton's Third Law tells us that for every force there is an equal and opposite force. We see that the force on particle 2 ($F_{12}$) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force on particle 1 ($F_{21}$).

If we write coulomb's law slightly differently, we can see that the force on a particle is proportional to its own charge:

$$F_{12} = \frac{kq_1}{r^2} \times q_2$$

and so

$$F_{12}\propto q_2$$

That is, if we *double* $q_2$, we *double* $F_{12}$; if we *triple* $q_2$, we *triple* $F_{12}$, etc..

If we think separately about the effect of particle 1 at distance $r$, and particle 2's charge, we see:


$\underbrace{F_{12}}\_\text{Force on particle 2} =  \underbrace{\frac{kq_1}{r^2}}\_\text{effect of particle 1 at distance $r$} \times q_2$

We call the effect of particle 1 at distance $r$ the *electric field* due to particle 1,

$$E_1 = \underbrace{\frac{kq_1}{r^2}}_{\text{effect of particle 1 at distance $r$}}$$

which allows us to refer to the force on particle 2 ($F_{12}$) as:

$$
\begin{align\*}
F_{12} &= \frac{kq_1}{r^2} &\times q_2 \\\\
&= \underbrace{E_1}_\text{effect of particle 1 at distance $r$} &\times q_2 \\\\
\end{align\*}
$$

This gives the equation

$$F = Eq$$

where $E$ depends on *charge somewhere*, but $q$ refers to the charge of the particle experiencing the force.

We can also rearrange this as

$$ E = \frac{F}{q}$$

to **characterize Electric Field as *Force per unit charge* **.

Force has units *newtons* ($N$), charge has units *coulombs* ($C$), and electric field has units *newtons per coulomb* ($\frac{N}{C}$).
