# Review of Work and Power!

Pages 110-120 in your textbook tell this same story, but the video in this page may be a faster way to absorb that material.

## Work
$$W = F \times d$$

The weight (downward force due to gravity) exerted by a dumbell is $80 N$. If you push against that $80 N$ over a distance of $1 m$, the work you have exerted is

$$
\begin{align\*}
W &= \overbrace{(80 N)}^\text{Force} \times \overbrace{(1m)}^\text{distance} \\\\
&= 80 Nm\\\\
&= 80 J
\end{align\*}
$$

The unit $1 J$ is $1$ *Joule*, which is equal to $1$ *Newton Meter*, which is $(1N)\times (1m)$. $1J$ is the amount of work (energy) required to push against a $1N$ force over a distance of $1m$.

## Power

$$P = \frac{W}{\Delta t}$$

* The downward **force** exerted by a $40kg$ dumbell is $\overbrace{(40kg)\times(9.8m/s^2)}^{F_g = mg} = 392 N$.

* The **work** required to push that dumbell up $50cm$ ($0.5 m$) is $\overbrace{(392 N)\times(0.5m)}^{W=Fd}=196 J$.

* After $50$ reps, $50\times 196 J =9800J$ of work has been done.

* The power of this lifter over $600 s$ (10 minutes) was
$$
\begin{align\*}
P &= \overbrace{\frac{9800J}{600s}}^{P=\frac{W}{\Delta t}}\\\\
&\approx 16.3 J/s\\\\
&= 16.3 W
\end{align\*}
$$

The unit $1 W$ is $1$ *Watt*, which is equal to $1$ *Joule per Second*, which is $\frac{1J}{1s}$. $1W$ is the rate of energy per unit time required to do $1J$ of work over $1s$.
